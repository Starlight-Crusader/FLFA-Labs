# NFA to DFA conversion
### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: **Kalamaghin Arteom (FAF-211)**

## Objectives

**1.** Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

**2.** Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added: 

        a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy;
        b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

**3.** According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

        a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar;
        b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic;
        c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA;
        d. (Optional - bonus point) Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point).
